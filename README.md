## Planetary Gearbox (3-speed)
![Exploded](images/Quad_View.png)
- Project: 3-Speed planetary gear box with OD
- Objective: Learn tolerancing, backlash controls, and selectable gear ratios. 
- Approach: Module 1.25 gears, identical planets, printed prototypes in PLA/ PETG. Manual Clutches to fix certain members to change gear ratios. Effective remodel of a traditional Simpsons Gear. Ran clearance testing, bearing bores referencing to positional tolerances, section views and full mechanical assemblies. 
- Sanity Checks: Math behind gear ratios, such as when fixing different components 
- Results: Smooth Hand driven Exploded gear box, predictable assemblies, engineering drawings with selective tolerancing points.
